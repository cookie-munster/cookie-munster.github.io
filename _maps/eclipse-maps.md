An eclipse mapping craze has been taking the cartography community by storm. I decided to add my contributions. My main contribution is the map inspired by moonbird, which adds in my love of ornithology. Another contribution is my "firefly" map:

Here's a collection of these maps from twitter, cartographers sure know how to have fun! I enjoy these immensely.
