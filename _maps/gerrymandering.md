This year I applied to the ESRI StoryMaps Competition by creating a mapping project examining gerrymandering. I had great fun with this project, including creating the crisp small multiples map above, to the less sophisticated but still fun map of stick figures getting sliced by district lines:

The live project will likely be taken down at some point, so I've created a video stepping through the project to preserve it more permanently:
