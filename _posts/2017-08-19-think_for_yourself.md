There are many things to say and read in response to Charlottesville. My thoughts are that after you reflect, form your own thoughts. Don't just copy the ideas of your favorite radio host, tv pundit, or op-ed writer. One of the greatest freedoms you have is the freedom of thought - don't voluntarily give it up. Forming your own thoughts and reactions to an event like Charlottesville allows for a greater humanity to be brought into the equation. Don't necessarily let it be about politics or culture, let it be about people. What is your reaction, and why? What is the result of that internal reflection? How will things now change for you in the future? These should be the questions that matter: questions that lead to action, your action.

If you want to venture out there: watch media that has as little rhetoric as possible and shows long uninterrupted clips such as the [Vice media newscast](https://youtu.be/RIrcB1sAN8I) or media that includes full unedited remarks [NY Times full press-conference transcript](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/15/us/politics/trump-press-conference-transcript.html). Clear your mind, take a breath, and listen. This takes longer, but isn't it worth 20 minutes of your time to read / watch for yourself? I'd encourage that investment.

When you accept others' ideas or values as your own without challenging or considering it in a broader context, you run the risk of being manipulated, even to the point of being unethical yourself. To see how, check out the Milgram experiment in documentary form:
