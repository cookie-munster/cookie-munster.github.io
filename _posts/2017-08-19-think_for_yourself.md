There are many things to say and read in response to Charlottesville. You should read them. My thoughts are that after you do that, form your own thoughts. Don't just copy the ideas of your favorite radio host, tv pundit, or op-ed writer and pass them off as our own. One of the greatest freedoms you have is the freedom of thought - don't voluntarily give it up.

If you want to venture out there: watch media that has as little rhetoric as possible and shows long uninterrupted clips such as the [Vice media newscast](https://youtu.be/RIrcB1sAN8I) or media that includes full unedited remarks [NY Times full press-conference transcript](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/15/us/politics/trump-press-conference-transcript.html). This takes longer, but isn't it worth 20 minutes of your time to read / watch for yourself? This should be important enough for that. 

When you accept others' ideas or values as your own, you run the risk of being manipulated, even to the point of being unethical yourself. To see how, check out the Milgram experiment in documentary form:
