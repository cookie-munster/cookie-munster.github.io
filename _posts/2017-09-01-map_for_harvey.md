One small thing you can do to help with hurricane harvey is to map buildings and roads in affected areas. It's much easier than you'd expect, and can do it from your couch while watching TV / Netflix.

For instructions and walkthroughs on how to get started if you haven't used Open Street Map before, see the guides on: [Missing Maps Project](http://www.missingmaps.org/learn)

Then when you've got your open street map account, head on over to the task manager and pick a project. Harvey needs will show up on top until completed. [http://tasks.openstreetmap.us/](http://tasks.openstreetmap.us/)
